You19:47
sorry idk why i called just chest was weird and just random anxiety and i didnt know what to do im sorry
idk for some reason mic isnt working
idk if youre here ill just drop these
just
idk
are you alright? is something going on? did i do something that made you feel weird? just idk
You19:49
i feel so weird, like as if maybe im making you uncomfortable even when talking of making out
idk like this whole vibe has just never happened to me in like both the relationships that were actually bad and way longer, so i feel like i have no idea what is happening, and i spend an inordinate amount of my time and energy worrying about it
which i really cannot afford to do right now
You19:50
but at some point its just jaw clenching physical panic attacks
and it just feels like some sort of thinking about some interaction and just tearing up by myself every other time. idk i feel like im going crazy, but also just
i feel worried too
are you doing okay
is there something you wanna tell me about
You19:51
idk just yeah
Alexey Izmailov19:52
o shit
i did not see any of this
sorry
i was talking to the dumb this time
fuck
You19:54
just yeah idk if something is wrong, like even if its not about us
idk i hope you know
you can come to me
Alexey Izmailov19:54
i know i can
and um
i'm sorry if the way i am nowadays makes it feel like you can't do the same?
You19:55
and im sorry if i madfe you uncomfortable, like about any stupid teenager brain shit its like always fine ofc to not be in a mood or whatever, but i just idk almost feel like its repulsive if i talk about just even kisisng you and idk
i just im not sure if im being insane
Alexey Izmailov19:56
uhhhh
i'm not really sure which thing you're referring to
i don't have any repulsion thing about teenager brain or anything
like idk it's fucking ego-boosting to hear these sorts of things from you
i think
like
before you hung up the last thing you said was something about getting high
now what does kinda set some sort of discomfort feeling off is this substance stuff, whether it's drinking or drugs or anything
Alexey Izmailov19:57
i'm pretty clean except for nicotine and i don't really see myself drinking a lot or using other drugs much
like i don't even light up with the apes when there's like a kilo of weed that i can just use whenever
You19:57
oki
Alexey Izmailov19:58
like
You19:58
thats fair
Alexey Izmailov19:58
it's not something you do really
like i worry about you with all this substance stuff
and if there is *something* that really does feel off for me it's like
being generally clean is the sort of attitude ive taken on and intend to stay with
at least until i've figured out the vast majority of my adulting things out
and just every time someone starts bringing this sort of stuff up a lot i have some sort of immediate response against that
Alexey Izmailov19:59
it's like why i stopped talking to hs anti-drug PSA friend
You19:59
okay i'll keep that in mind
i mean that's fair
and yeah idk i was just joking tbh with the weed thjing
think i just wanted to say the latter part of that sentence
because weed makes me panic anyway
but yeah idk i just idk what has me in this weird mental state recently
You20:00
but i feel like for the last one month i am at a breaking point everyday where i wanna hold my face to not cry badly its so
stupid
and idk what to do about it
sorry
Alexey Izmailov20:01
hey
it's okay
you don't have to apologize to me
i care about you
and i'm worried about you
and like
yeah objectively this year is the hardest for both of us
you're under a fuckload of stress
and it's no wonder you feel the way you do most days, and i'm sorry if i contribute to that
i'm not supposed to be in your life to contribute to that
i'm  supposed to do the opposite for you
You20:02
its not even like youre doing something wrong
just idk whats up with me
Alexey Izmailov20:02
heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
nothing is going terribly wrong
it's just insane stress and idk maybe i'm being kinda neglectful
cuz i force out my stress onto getting ahead with adult things
but for you i really think it's a passing thing
like the stress and uncertainty and everything that's shit right now
you're making progress towards being in a better place in the future ,but right now it's really fucking tough
Alexey Izmailov20:03
i'm here
and you can come to me whenever
like the whole point of you keeping me around is for me to help with this big overwhelm
You20:05
just yeah idk i feel too sensitive and vulnerable for some reason
i dont fucking like being like this
it feels like walking like an open wound
and yeah idk i thought
things would feel fine after we talked on the doc
You20:06
and just maybe it would have if i wasnt so
on edge
all the time
just yeah idk sorry
its just recently it becomes
physically debilitating like i just lied down on bed aftger the meet and
idk
Alexey Izmailov20:07
heyy
i know a bit about the being on edge thing
um
it's okay with being overly sensitive, at least here
ynkow you can talk things through with me?
idk what to tell you
i think you're letting things get to you too much
You20:07
it just feels humiliating to be liek this
im not like this
idk why am i being like this
and i just feel like a wounded puppy now
sorry for the metaphors with wounded
but just idk
and ig also
idk how to like do something calmly in between yk
i either shut down or just
You20:09
and like ofc i understand you're just doing life
and i want you to do life stuff and not worry about this
but somehow i feel so on edge about some random itneraction and then i question whether you can even stand me and it feels pathetic
Alexey Izmailov20:10
hey
i know you're gonna hate me saying this
but truly unironically
just deep breaths and *chill*
things are okay
seriously
nothing is going wrong
i'm here on call with you every time you feel shit about some interaction
and tbf i haven't been too good lately either
but yeah when it comes to us, we can always talk it out
You20:10
like its just the tiniest things
getting to me
like when you just casually went
sorry i didnt read this you email a lot of things
its like the entire tone of how we talk is different, and yeah itd hurt normallyt oo
but ig id get over it usually
but now i just feel emotionally worse somehow
You20:12
that was a mean thing to say though
id never say that
Alexey Izmailov20:12
okay, i'm sorry about that o ne
i definitely did not mean that unironically
we're always ironic around here, remember?
but no yeah i was just tryna submit a thing by the noon deadline
so i hadn't been checking much of emails
You20:13
ive never minded that
just yeah
as you said that day when we were talking in the doc
its like ok it was some cool thing where we dump random shit throughout the day, idk i still get excited when i get an email from you
and ig its just nice to feel like somebody feels that about you
You20:15
anyway just yeah didnt know what to do
still dont
but i think shutting down for a bit is the way to go
Alexey Izmailov20:15
hope you can restart after the shut down
wouldn't want to replace the hardware yknow
/reinstally the OS
not sure which metaphor is better here
You20:16
i mean i have pretty damaged hardware and a badly managed os
You20:18
yeah
thanks
and sorry
Alexey Izmailov20:18
quit apologizing you dimwit
and no don't apologize for apologizing
im here
i understand shut down mode and i'll be here waiting for you when you'd like to come back
You20:19
and just
yeah i know you have a lot of shit going on in the next few months, just, i hope you take care of yourself
and dont burn yourself out
and also you can come to me for hugs
if you want them
Alexey Izmailov20:20
so can you dimwit
i'm not going anywhere
and just yeah um
no dying please
shit is stressful, but you can figure it out
and yeah try not to die in the process of figuring?
please?
also calorize and drink water
those are important things that are sometimes forgotten
i'm here for you to come back to
You20:21
i was having my second
asking riya if im unattractive, but this time just asking myself
moment
Alexey Izmailov20:21
won't even ask me
i'
You20:22
i think there's time before i turn 40
so i hope im not
Alexey Izmailov20:22
i'm not any more or less biased than asking yourself
in magnitude
You20:22
got it i should kms
thanks
Alexey Izmailov20:22
E D G Y
You20:23
i mean that was my response to my question
but yeah idk
ig it was just
the same circle of just
yeah
dont think there's anything i can do about it, it does suck a lot of life force out of me
You20:24
and i dont think ive ever experienced sometghing like this before
i feel so unprepared
Alexey Izmailov20:24
how would you have prepared though
You20:24
idk
but its just
yeah idk
ive had toxic sitaution/relationships but those were just bad
and the problem was somebody just being shit me or them whatever
You20:25
and now its like ok this person cares about me theyre just not really into me anymore
and just
how to even process that
its kinda anti life affirming
and idk
maybe itd be easier if i could hug you irl
You20:26
although idk
do you really think it makes sense to like
be with somebody long term if youre not into them anymore
Alexey Izmailov20:27
depends
is being with that person still better than being a turbo virgin/
i've spent my fair share of years in turbo virgin mode
this feels better than that
though i guess you can say that's not a high bar to pass
but idk
still beats being alone, at least for m
You20:28
yeah maybe we shouldnt be doing this then
if this is all we have
fuck
i feel like everything breaking into a million pieces
im fine with being alone
im not here because otherwise id be alone
there's no guy in the whole world i want in my bed
idk
You20:29
if yyou could do better or whatever do that
like i didnt think it really had gotten this abd
where you're literally not into me
fufck
idk what do you even mean by nothing is wrong then
like?
You20:30
this isnt normal? people dont date people theyre not attracted top
Alexey Izmailov20:31
you think i could do better
idk still stuck up on that comment
i don't think i could *do* at all
but whatever
idk
i think you're strawmanning me
You20:31
how do you think it feels like to be told
that
Alexey Izmailov20:31
i never said i'm not into you anymore
You20:32
im with you because id wanna have somebody than nobody at all
and i mean i asked whether it makes sense to date somebody youre not into
and you didnt deny that and said depends
like idk what should i make of that
Alexey Izmailov20:32
i took that as a general question
like some of the general questions i ask sometimes
but that's beside the point
You20:32
BRO PHILOSOPHY CLASS?
Alexey Izmailov20:32
i never said that i'm not into you or something
i just said comparatively
You20:32
no i was asking about us
Alexey Izmailov20:32
to like
the summer
i feel like
a combination of things has happened that has really just put me in a place where i'm comparatively less into you than the summer
You20:33
like if youre with me because you think otherwise youd have no one  that makes no sense
and i remember this in like last conversation about some
better to be vaguely warm than alone
i dont wanna be vaguely warm
ive been alone and ive been with people
Alexey Izmailov20:34
so what do you really want then?
You20:34
idk im just
still shook?
like?
idk you know exactly why im shook as well
You20:35
like after everything we've been through this is not exactly the stuff one expects and just not the most
special feeling
that oh its ok to have you around for now
because otherwise id be alone
there's nobody id choose over you
literally nobody
You20:36
idk what to say or do either
but this doesnt feel okay or fair
would you want to be with me if i was just with you to avoid being lonely
if thats why i started talking to you
You20:38
i was genuinely very strictly like "im gonna stay away from being with somebody" when we were talking more, and just, yeah you were fucking special so
it happened anyway
i wasnt just trying to have some guy in my life for the skae of it
You20:39
even the worst people in my life didnt have me around because its better than nothing. it just
feels so shit
and i mean that makes sense at this point
you cant like force yourself to like somebody or not be neglectful or whatever
if you dont wanna be with them in the first place really
You20:40
this literally is just everything
i dont have a placeholder spot here that im filling up
if we're not doing the same thing wtf am i doing
clearly we're doing very different things with eafch other
You20:41
i still sit and plan what books ill send you
im still making the
big fucking thing of random annotations ion this overleaf project
that iw as making just for you
Alexey Izmailov20:45
idk
you say placeholder or whatever
i don't think that's what you're doing
i don't think that's what you mean for me
you were and are who i have always wanted in my life
it's just i physically don't feel capable of feeling what i thought i would feel at this point in my life
maybe most of my psychic energy is elsewhere, maybe i don't know what i want anymore
You20:46
is it me?
or does it include me?
Alexey Izmailov20:46
i do want you around in my life,  duh
Alexey Izmailov20:47
idk
i was still looking forward to celebrating you getting into grad school
and celebrating your preprints
and like, when i say everything is okay, i mean that none of those big things have changed
i just
idk i don't feel the same
and minor things set me off, like the drug things
and so idk
idk what to tell you
Alexey Izmailov20:49
you still are special to me
you are the coolest person in my life
You20:49
but a lot of it sounds like some "i still wanna be friends with you". but now this
reminds me of that
stupid
song about
not being able to be just friends with somebody
idk if you remember
the one in our playlist
Alexey Izmailov20:50
i'll be honest, not really
You20:50
its okay
but yeah
i feel all of those things
and also im in love with you
that makes me a very big fool now
doesnt it
Alexey Izmailov20:51
i dont think so
im gonna keep on my thing of like
i don't think this is break-up feul
fuel*
i want to be around you
and i do mean it when i say i love you
do i mean it in the same way i said it like 3 months ago?
not really in the same way?
You20:52
what does that really mean though
like you have some vague goodwill transmission i love you but you arent in love with me?
Alexey Izmailov20:52
well what does being in love really mean
You20:52
ok philosopher
Alexey Izmailov20:52
i don't think it's a vague goodwill transmission thing either, false dichotomy
You20:53
it meaans all the things youd feel for your best friend but also you often want to softly kiss them and it makes your entire body crumble sometimes when you think of them
Alexey Izmailov20:53
check
You20:53
ig thats what it feels like for me
Alexey Izmailov20:53
okay so how are we different?
if we use that definition, we're the same
i'd want nothing else than to tenderly kiss you right now
and just lie in a blanket tightly holding you
You20:54
big want
Alexey Izmailov20:54
and i've been holding back some sniffles for a few minutes now
and it's just
idk
You20:54
really big want
Alexey Izmailov20:54
ouch
if you wanna break up, you gotta pull the plug
You20:54
i really dont
i love you
Alexey Izmailov20:54
i love you dimwit
You20:55
its just scary to think im in love with somebody who is losing interest in me everyday and will slowly one day disappear
and who tolerates my presence and will enver get exfcited about seeing me or hearing from me again
because i do
all the time
Alexey Izmailov20:55
why do you think i don't get excited?
You20:55
even when i wish i didnt i do
nobody in my whole life has madfe me feel this weak because of how helplessly i cant deny what i feel
Alexey Izmailov20:56
what do you think i'm looking forward to at the end of this sem?
slow down
yeah i'm looking forward to looking at bajaj's fat ass all day
yeah i'm looking forward to +45 degree weather
and again more and more sleepless weeks
no you dimwit
the one thing that's actually redeeming about the next few months is getting to see you
You20:57
i had this
paranoia that youd not wanna talkt o me by then or soemthing
Alexey Izmailov20:57
bruh!
You20:57
and id walk around and look at all
your stuff
yk
the snow globe
pen
books
some diary with letters
and think that
i should just
mail these to you
Alexey Izmailov20:57
bruh!
slow down
jesus christ
damn you already almost broke up with me without saying a word to me
good to know
You20:58
hey
i didnt
i just
keep thinking through worst case scenarios
because i feel so vulnerable
that way im like
ok he'll leave me wjateber
and god its heartbreaking
You20:59
i dont want this to end at all
not even a little bit
Alexey Izmailov20:59
if you wanna break up, you pull the plug
your move
You20:59
you stupid fuck ll kiss you
i said i dont
Alexey Izmailov20:59
uhhuh
sounds good to me <3
i'm not tryna break up bruh
You21:00
yeah but this is why the current "youre just better than nothing" thing was like oh so this personw ill keep me arolund till they think they can have something they actually want or whatever
Alexey Izmailov21:00
i still think you're the life maximum
okay bruh
first off
we're not there
yes i'll admit my psychic energy is eaten up by adult and life doom et al
but no we're not at the "better than nothing" stage
not even close
idk
i thought you were like
idk i think i'm retarded
but i thought you were asking it as some veiled thing about how you felt
Alexey Izmailov21:01
i already knew that i was getting into one hell of a conversation
so i figured i'd give you atleast a truthful response and somewhat postiive to set it off
but i guess i did the absolute opposite of that
to be fair, i was big dumb there
You21:02
i wasnt being veiled
i was just like
asking you point blank
Alexey Izmailov21:02
you asked
You21:02
we're both autistic
Alexey Izmailov21:02
if i thought
staying with a person when they're "better than nothing" is worth it
You21:02
yeah thought about us like asking you to judge your own situation
Alexey Izmailov21:02
you didn't ask if i thought i was sticking around because (hypothetically) i thought you're just "better than nothing"
you didn't ask about us though bruh
it was a veiled question!
if you want like a context-specific response, you have to ask a context-specific question
You21:03
im retarded too then
Alexey Izmailov21:03
wtf
You21:03
but yeah i just
meant like
Alexey Izmailov21:03
okay great retards united
You21:03
very directly
Alexey Izmailov21:03
what a fucking rollercoaster of a conversation
You21:03
i dont really play game questions with you
Alexey Izmailov21:03
"not really"
okay
you
fucker!
<3
You21:03
will you hold me
Alexey Izmailov21:04
yes
You21:04
there's three-four college girls in my kitchen
lovely sounds
Alexey Izmailov21:04
introduce me to them?
maybe not the best time to drop that joke
You21:05
yeah maybe ill say hi to their boyfriends
Alexey Izmailov21:05
uhhuh
well
actually
competition is stiffer for me
Alexey Izmailov21:05
you have 2x to introduce yourself to right
You21:05
i could get both
Alexey Izmailov21:05
yep
You21:05
girl and guy
yeah
yeah if you dump me for a girl
im gonna steal her back
Alexey Izmailov21:06
well symmetric if you dump me for a girl
if it's a guy i'll just become friends with him and lobotomize him
dw
easier between bros
anyway
Alexey Izmailov21:07
look i'm sorry i got things to this point
that we're now having conversations that are a few words from break-up convos
i don't want to break up with you, neither do i think we're in a "better than nothing" sort of thing
i'm just like
90% of the emotions i feel nowadays are fear, anxiety, and depression
You21:08
let me hold you close
Alexey Izmailov21:08
which is a far greater proportion than it was back in the day!
i love you and just
yeah
i don't wanna break up
You21:08
tight hug?
Alexey Izmailov21:08
yes.
gibbs
You21:08
my chest feels pretty tight too
hug would be nice
Alexey Izmailov21:09
im ready to stress sleep till 2 am now
on sunday when we had our last big bad convo
i just slept for 10 hours after that
these sort of convos end up in me sleeping for half a day afterwards :(
can i sleep with you?
Alexey Izmailov21:10
sorry
trash can has old trash
should take that out
the smells hit me
and i wasn't even wafting!
You21:10
go take it ou
just
yeah ig
idk what did you then mean by when you siad the whole like yeah general response, like what was that about, i mean thats when i got really worried
just confused because i dont wanna be dumb autistic
@ communication
Alexey Izmailov21:11
i mean i do think that as a general thing
clearly you disagree
then again idk
You21:11
i mean i think if youre NOT into someone
then like its unfair to them aws well to be with them
because they know too, and its really painful to feel unwanted by somebody you love
everyday
thats just selfish to do, if you wanna avoid being lonely
cant say ive not done that
i did that in high school,
Alexey Izmailov21:13
yea
same
i did that in high school
and i know how it feels
for one, making out with that person does not feel good
kissing you feels epic
and just yeah
i wanna kiss you
legit
UNironically
You21:13
prove it
Alexey Izmailov21:13
im gonna haul ass to finland
yeah so
uh
im definitely staying around you to be lonely
because uh
in 3 weeks i'll be flying across the fucking world
to see your dumbass
yeah that's what people do when they're just around cuz they're afraid to be lonely
yup
makes crystal clear sense
wtf
You21:14
just prove that you wanna kiss me
everything else is noise
come on
Alexey Izmailov21:14
what do you want me to do?
starve myself for a kiss?
do you want a mathematical proof?
a numerical proof?
a syllogism?
You21:15
what numerical proofs can you offer
is this my
being loved to the point of invention era
i always saw that story and felt
ME WHEN
Alexey Izmailov21:16
in 10 years are we gonna be talking about how you didn't feel like that era happened for you
and that you shoulda been with someone else instead of me
i was your life's biggest mistake because i never invented somthing in your name
You21:16
make it happen then
Alexey Izmailov21:16
yo
You21:16
do it
mutual benefit
you got an invention
Alexey Izmailov21:17
here i'll shit out a mesh of a heart in gmsh
