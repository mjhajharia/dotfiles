Really that's the only thing that matters at the moment. Here's three things I want to do after these are done: drink, remove internet presence, hoard and organize audio, PDFs etc. For now, here are the immediate overdue things:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write the goddamn SOP
    \item Email Bob, Aki and Bagai with all the relevant material (\textbf{TODAY})
    \item If possible email some people or discuss with Bob and Aki. 
    \item Get SOP feedback from Bob, Aki and Matin
    \item Send Matin Notebooks
    \item Send Bob and Aki some Plots
\end{itemize}
