\noindent \mytitle{Graduate School Applications}

Really that's the only thing that matters at the moment. Here's three things I want to do after these are done: drink, remove internet presence, hoard and organize audio, PDFs etc.

For now, here are the immediate overdue things:
- Write the goddamn SOP
- Email Bob, Aki and Bagai with all the relevant material (Due \textbf{TODAY})
- Make improvements on: Transforms, Diagnosing-HMC, Gen
- If possible email some people or discuss these things with Bob and Aki
