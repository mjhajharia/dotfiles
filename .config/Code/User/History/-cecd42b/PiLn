hold yours '
Alexey Izmailov07:01
yea sorry eye hurtie
sorry you were saying
soonsies
i woke up at 6pm today
what do you mean?
disregarding the fact that i woke up ~6 hours ago
Alexey Izmailov07:02
it's like eye muscle pain tho
i've been using my eyes a lot lately
it's just fuck around for us <3
have you?
Alexey Izmailov07:04
kiss
You07:06
kiss
Alexey Izmailov08:09
no, i'm not going to call the cops on you dimwit
sorry if i took that too far
i didn't mean to hurt you
Alexey Izmailov08:12
what do you mean i'm not here though
like what is it that makes you think i'm not here
that i just start clowning around really fast?
idk i'd say you prolly have a clearer understanding of what that means than me
Alexey Izmailov08:13
because clearly you feel something
say which part?
Alexey Izmailov08:15
it's so strange to me yknow
i still choose to write you long-ass emails at 5am
then hang  out here for like 6 hours straight a
and it's like
what i get in response is that i'm  apparently not "here"
that things are "off"
and it's just like
sure maybe i don't feel as identically high amplitude as in the beginning
but i still choose to do these sorts of things
and now that's not enough or something
or the *way in which i'm doing them* is off now
Alexey Izmailov08:16
so idk what you even mean or what you ~want~ really
Alexey Izmailov08:18
okay
i'm sorry about the joke
i should not have said that and like
it's not like i've forgotten the convo we had about this on the flatiron roof
or like the song or like
you being super embarrassed about sharing it
yes
i remember that conversation
i know
it's not like i don't remember these things
Alexey Izmailov08:19
it's kinda like i've gotten loose in what i say methinks
but
with regards to yesterday's convo
idk what to tel you
i still choose to be here
Alexey Izmailov08:22
okay
so what happens next then
like there's really 2 ways here
either just pull the plug, you block me everywhere, just go big turbo autist lonely mode
or j ust like, exist? be vaguely warm around each other? not lonely? fuck around? find out eventually?
idk
i don't think like
me feeling dampened or whatever is a reason to just gut this
Alexey Izmailov08:24
like
i know you feel kinda shit about it
idk i dont think like something monumental needs to happen
i'm sorry about the joke
i need to watch my words
Alexey Izmailov08:25
well
i should be apologizing to you
so then like
me admitting that i feel dampened is why you feel shit about this?
like
idk what specific thing you think i'm doing wrong or is off
because at this point it'swhat just me admitting something to you?
hinging on that?
Alexey Izmailov08:27
okay to reiterate what is the situation really
Alexey Izmailov08:28
idk i feel generally comfortable
like around you
you're still hands down the most significant person in my life
and the coolest person i knows
but it's like
i don't have some sort of like burning passion thingie like i did in the first few months
or even 6 months ago
does that mean this has lost meaning for me?
maybe?
Alexey Izmailov08:29
i don't think it's anywhere near being "actually meaningless" for me
i'd be quite sad if you dumped me
i'd appreciate if you didn't make me sad like that
Alexey Izmailov08:31
:)
i mean
how do people who spend like 50 years together make it through everything
you think after even 5 years those people have the same sort of feeling for each other as they did early one?
on*
they just exist
and it's cool
idk what like
Alexey Izmailov08:32
i still routinely like on a daily basis feel some sort of tender heart collapse-y feeling from something you say or do
i think you're the opposite of meaningless to me if that happens
and idk maybe like with like moods and stuff, a phase just takes longer for me than it does for you
idk maybe 1-2 months is too early to even tell really
and if this was truly meaningless to me, i wouldn't be here saying these things anyway
Alexey Izmailov08:33
i give very many shits about you
Alexey Izmailov08:34
good talk
ya think?
might i remind you
that you started this line of talks yesterday
the seminar continued today but like
you gave the opening convocation
Alexey Izmailov08:36
what things were you expecting?
what things do you think concretely changed?
what even suggested to you in the first place that things were going downhill?
the quality of conversation
the quality of conversation!
Alexey Izmailov08:37
?????
what is 0.767?
oh
i thought
this was some well-known math meme
you fucker
Alexey Izmailov08:39
i'll do it for you
i hate myself more!
????
why THE FUCK
would i do that while we're making out
nooooooooooooooo
Alexey Izmailov08:40
broooo
yes i do
that's fucked
can i be on the list of things to do?
Alexey Izmailov08:41
i think the top so you have more energy
yea my pelvis hasn't been bruised in a hot sec
i can't believe no one had mentioned pain after that to you before
like really
Alexey Izmailov08:42
either i'm the first person you've done this to or like
???
Alexey Izmailov08:43
damn imagine fucking so much you collect statistics about these things
idk
i can say i'm like 100% almost every time
unless i get hurt or something
is ok
feels pretty good in the moment till it passes some threshold
i dont regret the pain from sex with you
Alexey Izmailov08:44
soon youll be back to a morgue
W
now you know how i felt about the one i gave you at flatiron
Alexey Izmailov08:46
yea i was inseparable from that
literally a virginity necklace lol
ah you broke the first necklace before i went to birthgivers
and not soon later you started noticing some downward change in me!
Alexey Izmailov08:47
so
if you really want to be superstitious about this
we should start there
ah but you said that things were slowing down back then even
and yesterday
you mentinoed that you felt things were going in this direction even in late october/november
oh
also
Alexey Izmailov08:48
if we wanna be superstitious
you broke both of them
and why did i say i feel dampenend?
because i feel smothered sometimes!
overwhelmed!
im just saying
if you wanna be superstitious about this
let's really look at what's going on
you breaking necklaces!
so do we want to be superstitiuos after all?
or do you wanna be normal rational people and just accept that shit just ebbs and flows?
Alexey Izmailov08:49
and that, at least for myself, i'd rather fuck around and find out, than to cut this off early
sorry i had a diff point to try to make
but yea
i'm down for new necklaces
i mean it's the like oversaturation thing
and like
Alexey Izmailov08:50
even back when the first necklace broke, i said something about you being gentle
and i think even back then i felt like some saturation thing was happening
but like
i'm not just gonna say that
cuz you were already depressed enough
i didnt wanna contribute to that by feeding one of the things you're afraid you'd do to me
and i t's just like
this cursed feeling for me
that i try to be like
well
docile is a bad word
Alexey Izmailov08:51and like yea i hope it's some short term feeling thing

but as harmless as i can be at each step and like
it's not pity though
Alexey Izmailov08:56
we're all hypocrites here
yea i really don't think any processes i've described or could describe to you are at all foreign to you
nor do i think the sorts of short term emotions i feel are different from something you might occasionally feel
Alexey Izmailov08:57
yea
idk
i don't want this to end, i'd be very sad if you dumped me
Alexey Izmailov08:59
yes i know
i feel like in some ways that feeling has kinda compounded for me
and idk what to really do about it
what what?
funneee sounds
Alexey Izmailov09:01
you as welel, fellow hypocritee
Alexey Izmailov09:03
i mean we managed it towards the end methinks
soon!
Alexey Izmailov09:04
hug!
bruh!
kiss!
:(
no fucking, no email responses!
!
???

Alexey Izmailov09:05
