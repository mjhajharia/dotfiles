\noindent \mytitle{still getting the hang of this thing}

So from the time I last wrote, I almost had a breakup with Alexey, we had a serious conversation, he made me laugh a lot. I drank a lot of gin, Aman fucked up with Aarushi, I don't know what to make of him. The selfish part of me just wants to cut him out of my life because I don't care for the drama. Dhruv sent a rather sappy email. Work life is a complete ruin, so I come here to seek some semblance of sanity.
