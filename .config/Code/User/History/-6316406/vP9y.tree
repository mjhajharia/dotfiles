\subsubsection{Stick-breaking power-CDF transforms}

Let $H$ be the CDF of any continuous distribution supported on the entire real line, $H^{-1}$ be its quantile function, and $h$ be its density function.

\paragraph{Unconstraining transform} $$

\paragraph{Constraining transform} $g_i^{-1}(y_i) = 1 - H(y_i)^{1/(N-i)}$

\paragraph{Change-of-variables adjustment}
