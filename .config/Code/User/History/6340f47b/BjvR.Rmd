**Aalto 2022** course can be taken online except for the final project
presentation. The lectures will be given on campus, but recorded and the
recording will be made available online after the course. If you are
unable to register for the course at the moment in the Sisu, there is no
need to email the lecturer. You can start taking the course and register
before the end of the course. Sisu shows rooms on campus for the
computer exercises, but only some of the computer exercises and TA
sessions are on campus and most of the session are online (we are
preparing the schedule). You can choose which TA session to join each
week separately, without a need to register for those sessions.

## Book: BDA3

::: {style="float:right;position: relative;"}
![](bda_cover.png)
:::

[The electronic version of the course book Bayesian Data Analysis, 3rd
ed, by Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari,
and Donald Rubin](https://users.aalto.fi/~ave/BDA3.pdf) is available for
non-commercial purposes. Hard copies are available from [the
publisher](https://www.crcpress.com/Bayesian-Data-Analysis/Gelman-Carlin-Stern-Dunson-Vehtari-Rubin/p/book/9781439840955)
and many book stores. Aalto library has also copies. See also [home page
for the book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/), [errata for
the book](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/errata_bda3.txt),
and [chapter notes](chapter_notes/BDA_notes_all.pdf).

## Prerequisites

-   Basic terms of probability theory
    -   probability, probability density, distribution
    -   sum, product rule, and Bayes' rule
    -   expectation, mean, variance, median
    -   in Finnish, see e.g. [Stokastiikka ja tilastollinen
        ajattelu](http://math.aalto.fi/~lleskela/LectureNotes003.html)
    -   in English, see e.g. Wikipedia and [Introduction to probability
        and
        statistics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/readings/)
-   Some algebra and calculus
-   Basic visualisation techniques (R or Python)
    -   histogram, density plot, scatter plot
    -   see e.g. [BDA R demos](demos.html#BDA_R_demos)
    -   see e.g. [BDA Python demos](demos.html#BDA_Python_demos)

This course has been designed so that there is strong emphasis in
computational aspects of Bayesian data analysis and using the latest
computational tools.

If you find BDA3 too difficult to start with, I recommend

-   For regression models, their connection to statistical testing and
    causal analysis see [Gelman, Hill and Vehtari: "Regression and Other
    Stories"](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/).
-   [Richard McElreath: Statistical Rethinking, 2nd
    ed](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book is easier
    than BDA3 and the 2nd ed is excellent. Statistical Rethinking
    doesn't go as deep in some details, math, algorithms and programming
    as BDA course. Richard's lecture videos of [Statistical Rethinking:
    A Bayesian Course Using R and
    Stan](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019) are
    highly recommended even if you are following BDA3.
-   [Johnson, Ott, and Dogucu: Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Applied
    Bayesian Modeling](https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/)
-   For background prerequisites some students have found chapters 2, 4
    and 5 in [Kruschke, "Doing Bayesian Data
    Analysis"](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/)
    useful.

## Communication channels

-   [MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=37048) is
    used for some intial announcements, linking to Zulip and Peergrade,
    and some questionnaires.
-   The primary communication channel is the Zulip course chat (link in
    MyCourses)
    -   Don't ask via email or direct messages. By asking via common
        streams in the course chat, more eyes will see your question, it
        will get answered faster and it's likely that other students
        benefit from the answer.
    -   Login with Aalto account to the Zulip course chat
    -   If you have any questions, please ask in the public streams and
        get answers from course staff or other students (active students
        helping others will get bonus points)
    -   In the chat system, we will have separate streams for each
        assignment and the project.
    -   Stream **#general** can be used for any kind of general
        discussions and questions related to the course.
    -   All important announcements will be posted to **#announcements**
        (no discussion on this stream).
    -   Any kind of feedback is welcome on stream **#feedback**.
    -   We have also streams **#r**, **#python**, and **#stan** for
        questions that are not specific to assignments or the project.
    -   Stream **#queue** is used as a queue for getting help during [TA
        sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions).
    -   The lecturer and teaching assistants have names with "(staff)"
        or "(TA)" in the end of their names.
-   A weekly lecture time on campus includes times for questions and
    answers
-   If you need one-to-one help, please take part in the [TA
    sessions](assignments.html#TA_sessions) and ask there.
-   If you find errors in material, post in **#feedback** stream or
    [submit an issue in
    github](https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/issues).
-   Peergrade alerts: If you are worried that you forget the deadlines,
    you can set peergade to send you email when assignment opens for
    submission, 24 hours before assignment close for submission,
    assignment is open for reviewing, 24 hours before an assignment
    closes for reviewing if you haven't started yet, someone likes my
    feedback (once a day). Click your name -\> User Settings to choose
    which alerts you want.

## Assessment

[Assignments](assignments.html) (67%) and a [project work with
presentation](project.html) (33%). Minimum of 50% of points must be
obtained from both the assignments and project work.

## Schedule 2022

The course consists of 12 blocks in periods I and II. The blocks don't
match exactly specific weeks. For example, it's good start reading the
material for the next block while making the assignment for one block.
There are 9 assignments and a project work with presentation, and thus
the assignments are not in one-to-one correspondence with the blocks.
The schedule below lists the blocks and how they connect to the topics,
book chapters and assignments.

### Schedule overview

Here is an overview of the schedule. Scroll down the page to see
detailed instructions for each block. Remember that blocks are
overlapping so that when you are working on assignment for one block,
you should start watching videos and reading text for the next block.

    -   We highly recommend to submit all assignments Friday before 3pm
        so that you can get TA help before submission. As the course has
        students who work weekdays (e.g. FiTech students), the late
        submission until Sunday night is allowed, but we can't provide
        support during the weekends.
    -   this assignment checks that you have sufficient prerequisite
        skills (basic probability calculus, and R or Python)

## R and Python

We strongly recommend using R in the course as there are more packages
for Stan and statistical analysis in R. If you are already fluent in
Python, but not in R, then using Python may be easier, but it can still
be more useful to learn also R. Unless you are already experienced and
have figured out your preferred way to work with R, we recommend

-   installing [RStudio
    Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/),
-   [or use RStudio
    remotely](FAQ.html#How_to_use_R_and_RStudio_remotely)

See [FAQ](FAQ.html) for frequently asked questions about R problems in
this course. The [demo codes](demos.html) provide useful starting points
for all the assignments.

## Finnish terms

Sanasta "bayesilainen" esiintyy Suomessa muutamaa erilaista
kirjoitustapaa. Muoto "bayesilainen" on muodostettu yleisen
vieraskielisten nimien taivutussääntöjen mukaan: *"Jos nimi on
kirjoitettuna takavokaalinen mutta äännettynä etuvokaalinen,
kirjoitetaan päätteseen tavallisesti takavokaali etuvokaalin sijasta,
esim. Birminghamissa, Thamesilla." Terho Itkonen, Kieliopas, 6. painos,
Kirjayhtymä, 1997.*
