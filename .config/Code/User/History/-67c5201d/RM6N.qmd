** Goal of this Project**: Diagnostics for sampling problems in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, specially in regions of high curvature.

### Models used
- Simple models that lead to a Funnel (considering mostly low dimensional models) and looking ar various transformations to see if the funnel remains, linear transformations fail at this.

- Models used in the PathFinder paper
- Whitening transformations on Hessians
- Condition Number of Hessians
- Absolute Error (AdvancedHMC.jl)
- Funnels -- grad vs sigma, hiding the funnel with linear transformations on samples
- Distances to Normality
- Initial Momentum
- Experimenting with Metric Tensors
- Monge Metric for HMC instead of LMC
