** Goal of this Project**: Diagnostics for sampling problems in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, specially in regions of high curvature.

### Models used
- Simple models that lead to a Funnel (considering mostly low dimensional models) and looking ar various transformations to see if the funnel remains, linear transformations fail at this.

- Models used in the PathFinder paper (taking reference draws from PosteriorDB) to compare various approaches.

### Approaches
#### Hessian Based Approaches
- Variation of Condition Number of Hessian
- Whitening transformations on Hessians and then looking comparing Condition Numbers

#### Absolute error from HMC
- AdvancedHMC.jl Patch

### Other Transformations
- Varying versions of grad vs sigma on the funnel plots

### Distances to Normality
- KL Divergence ends up being difficult to compute for Multivariate cases

- Other Approaches ()

### Identifying regions leading to divergences
- Storing Initial point and momentum to recover the offending trajectory


- Funnels -- grad vs sigma, hiding the funnel with linear transformations on samples
- Distances to Normality
- Initial Momentum
- Experimenting with Metric Tensors
- Monge Metric for HMC instead of LMC






#### Pathfinder Models
