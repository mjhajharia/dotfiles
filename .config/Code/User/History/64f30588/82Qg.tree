The expanded-softmax constraining transform consists of applying the usual softmax to unconstrained parameters.
Without modification, this is non-bijective; however, if we augment the parameter space with logsumexp, then it can be made bijective.

\paragraph{Constraining transform} Let $r = \logsumexp(y)$. Then the constraining transform is defined as
\[
    \operatorname{expsoftmax}(y) = (\logsumexp(y), \softmax(y)_-) = (r, x_-)
\]
